        markdown: |
            French verbs can be split into a few different groups.
            These verbs have their own special conjugations, hence, irregular verbs.
            Learning each one will be a task of memorization!

                    If you wish to have something in French, learn these words.
                    
                        i       = j'ai        - ( je + ai )

                    This doesn't translate directly because of the different meanings for each of the roles.

            * All of the verbs end in `er`
            * All of the verbs in this category follow the same rules for conjugation
            * If you can remember the spelling, you will be able to correctly conjugate!

                    Here is the rules for all group one verbs. The stars can be replaced with any verb once you remove the `er` from the end.
                    
                        i       =    Je ****e
                        you     =    tu ****es
                        he      =    il ****e
                        she     =  elle ****e
                        we      =  nous ****ons
                        you(p)  =  vous ****ez
                        they(m) =   ils ****est
                        they(f) = elles ****est
                        
                    So to say `We eat`, you remove the ending of `manger` so you have `mang` and drop it into the case for `nous ****ons` to get the result of `nous mangeons`.... wait, what?
                    
                    That is right; `mangeons`. Some times an extra `e` will appear in the conjugations. Just like the irregular verbs, it is something to 'just remember'.
