        title: Irregular Verbs
        markdown: |
            French verbs can be split into a few different groups.
            These verbs have their own special conjugations, hence, irregular verbs.
            Learning each one will be a task of memorization!

            -   title: Avoir => To Have
                markdown: |
                    If you wish to have something in French, learn these words.

                        J'ai       => I have      - Je + ai
                        Tu as      => You have    - "two ahh" informal
                        Il a       => He has

                    This doesn't translate directly because of the different meanings for each of the roles.

            * All of the verbs end in `er`
            * All of the verbs in this category follow the same rules for conjugation

                    Here are the rules for all group one verbs. The stars can be replaced with any verb once you remove the `er` from the end.

                        Je    ****e   => I    ****
                        Tu    ****es  => You  ****
                        Il    ****e   => He   ****
                        Elle  ****e   => She  ****
                        Nous  ****ons => We   ****
                        Vous  ****ez  => You  ****  - formal
                        Ils   ****ent => They ****  - masculine plural
                        Elles ****ent => They ****  - feminine plural

                    So to say `We eat`, you remove the ending of `manger` so you have `mang` and drop it into the case for `nous ****ons` to get the result of `nous mangeons`.... wait, what?

                    That is right; `mangeons`. Some times an extra `e` will appear in the conjugations. Just like the irregular verbs, it is something to 'just remember'.
